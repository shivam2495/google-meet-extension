### Basic flow - 1st iteration
- meet.new is already there so can use that to reduce effort
- User clicks extension -> new tab opens with meeting joined -> meet info displayed
- Initial sharing mechanism would be copying the joining info provided right after joining
- If multiple accounts, prompt the first time and then store the choice in cookies
